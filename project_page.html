<p class="project-page-text"><span style="font-weight: 700;">The Money Factor - </span> 
Does R&D expenditure explain the drastic difference in performance between teams in Formula 1?<br>
This project aims to analyse the expenditure that constructors (teams) in Formula 1 spend on research and development, 
and how this translates to improved performance in races, measured by total points scored by teams in a season. This data has interesting implications, especially if the R&D data is available before the race season is completed,
as this means that predictions can be made for the outcomes of constructors championships at the end of the year. However, there are a number of complex factors at play in addition to 
R&D expenditure which affects race outcomes, so this project will simply build on this one area and will not consider factors that are difficult to quantify, such as driver skill.

<!-- /////////////////// SECTION 1 //////////////////////////////////// -->
<p class="bodyText" style="font-size: 30px;"><span style="color: rgb(19, 143, 242); font-weight: 700;">Section 1: </span>Yearly R&D Expenditure by Constructor</p><br>
<p class="project-page-text">
This section presents the R&D expenditure for 9 of the teams in Formula 1 between 2012 and 2020. Individual teams R&D expenditure can be seen by selecting from the dropdown list below the chart.
The data presented here was obtained from different sources for each year, including article posts on motorsports journalism websites. The full source list can be found <a>here</a>.
There were some issues with data collection for this section. Most of the teams in Formula 1 do not publicly disclose their expenditure on R&D and so the data presented is obtained by estimates from past expenditure, 
as well as data that is derived from the financial statements of the holding companies of some of the teams.
</p>
<!-- ///////////////////  CONTAINER WITH SECTION 1 CHART //////////////////////////////////// -->
<container class="bcontainer-project">


<div class="chart-project-section1" id="f1rdexp">
  <script>
    var rd_exp = "charts/project_charts/chart1_rd_data_interactive.json";
    vegaEmbed('#f1rdexp', rd_exp);
  </script>
</div>

<p class="project-page-text">
As can be seen on first chart, R&D expenditure varies per team, with some of the top teams spending many multiples of what smaller teams spend. 
However, expenditure across time for teams remains relatively consistent. The data collected here presents many challenges, the main one being replicability and reliability.
Each year, different online articles on different sites come up with estimated expenditures for teams, there is no one source of consistent and reliable information available. 
Therefore, this section must be manually updated. This is not a significant issue given the frequency of data, as the data only needs to be updated once a year.
This data was manually entered into an excel sheet and converted into a CSV file, which was then entered into a vega-lite specification.

<!-- /////////////////// SECTION 2 //////////////////////////////////// -->
<p class="bodyText" style="font-size: 30px;"><span style="color: rgb(19, 143, 242); font-weight: 700;">Section 2: </span>Historical constructor standings</p>
<br>
<p class="project-page-text">
This section presents the other side of our question. How well do each of the 9 teams selected perform each year? This data was obtained from the Ergast Formula 1 API which was accessed through python using <a target=”_blank” style="color: rgb(19, 117, 197);" href="https://github.com/tahaadamaly/tahaadamaly.github.io/blob/main/python/F1Project/chart-2-constructor-standings.ipynb">this script</a>.
This shows that the teams at the top end with large budgets, such as Mercedes, Red Bull and Ferrari generally perform better than the midfield teams.

</p>
<br>
<container class="bcontainer-project">

  <div class="chart-project-section1" id="f1constrstandings">
    <script>
      var constr_standings = "charts/project_charts/chart2_constructor_standings.json";
      vegaEmbed('#f1constrstandings', constr_standings);
    </script>
  </div>
  <p class="project-page-text">
    This section of the data is extremely reliable, and replicable. The python script linked above accesses the Ergast F1 API and simply needs to be rerun once a year
    To update the points of each team. When running this script again, the year needs to be changed to the current year. The data obtained from this API was heavily nested and so 
    python was used to access it, instead of directly accessing it in Vegalite. The data was also cleaned to only keep the 9 teams being analysed. It must also be noted that 3 of the teams (Alfa Romeo, Aston Martin, Alpine)
    have either changed names or changed owners in the last 10 years, and so the points scored by the previous team / team name are presented.
    However, the R&D values obtained in section 1 are obtained for the previous teams/team names as well but are labeled as the current team name 
    so this does not significantly affect the further analysis conducted below.
